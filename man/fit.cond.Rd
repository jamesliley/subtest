\arguments{
\item{Z}{an n x 2 matrix; \eqn{Z[i,1]}, \eqn{Z[i,2]} are the \eqn{Z_d} and \eqn{Z_a} scores respectively for the \eqn{i}th SNP}

\item{pars}{vector containing initial values of \code{pi0}, \code{pi1}, \code{tau}, \code{sigma1}, \code{sigma2}, \code{rho}.}

\item{C}{a term \eqn{C log(}\code{pi0}*\code{pi1}*\code{pi2}\eqn{)} is added to the likelihood so the model is specified.}

\item{weights}{SNP weights to adjust for LD; output from LDAK procedure}

\item{fit_null}{set to TRUE to fit null model with forced \code{rho}=0, \code{tau}=0}

\item{one_way}{if TRUE, fits a single-Gaussian for category 3, rather than the symmetric model. Requires signed Z scores.}

\item{syscov}{if subgroup proportions in the case group do not match those in the population, \eqn{Z_d} and \eqn{Z_a} scores must be transformed. This leads to a systematic correlation (see function \code{\link{syscor}}). This parameter forces adjustment of the fitted model to allow for this correlation.}

\item{sgm}{force \code{sigma1} \eqn{\ge sgm}, \code{sigma2} \eqn{\ge sgm}, \code{tau} \eqn{\ge sgm}. True marginals variances should never be less than 1, but some variation should be allowed.}

\item{fixpi1}{set to TRUE to fix \code{\link{pi1}} when fitting.}

\item{incl_z}{set to TRUE to include input arguments \code{\link{Z}} and \code{\link{weights}} in output. If FALSE these are set to null.}

\item{control}{additional parameters passed to the R function optim.}
}
\value{
a list of six objects (class \code{\link{3Gfit}}): \code{pars} is the vector of fitted parameters, \code{history} is a matrix of fitted parameters and pseudo-likelihood at each stage in the E-M algorithm, \code{logl} is the joint pseudo-likelihood of \eqn{Z_a} and \eqn{Z_d}, \code{logl_a} is the pseudo-likelihood of \eqn{Z_a} alone (used for adjusting PLR),  \code{z_ad} is n x 2 matrix of \eqn{Z_d} and \eqn{Z_a} scores, \code{weights} is the vector of weights used to generate the model, and \code{hypothesis} is 0 or 1 depending on the value of \code{\link{fit_null}}.

\description{
Fit a specific bivariate Gaussian mixture distribution, conditioning on one variable
}
\details{
The mixture distribution simultaneously models two sets of GWAS summary statistics arising from a control group and two case groups comprising subgroups of a disease case group of interest. The values \eqn{Z_{a}}{Z_a} correspond to Z-scores arising from comparing the control group with the combined case group, and the values \eqn{Z_{d}}{Z_d} from comparing one case subgroup with the other, independent of controls.

We expect that SNPs can be classified into three categories, corresponding to the three two-dimensional Gaussians in the joint distribution of \eqn{Z_{a}}{Z_a} and \eqn{Z_{d}}{Z_d}. These three categories are: SNPs not associated with the phenotype and not differentiating subtypes; SNPs associated with the phenotypebut not differentiating subtypes; and SNPs differentiating subtypes. 
 
Each of these three categories gives rise to a mixture Gaussian with a different shape. We are interested in whether the data support evidence that SNPs in the third category additionally differentiate cases and controls. Formally, we assume:

\deqn{
  Z_{a},Z_{d} ~ \pi_{0} G_{0} + \pi_{1} G_{1} + (1-\pi_{0}-\pi_{1}) G_{2}
 }{
  Z_a,Z_d ~ pi0 G0 + pi1 G1 + (1-pi0 - pi1) G2
 }

where \eqn{G_{0},G_{1}}{G0, G1} are bivariate Gaussians with mean \eqn{(0,0)} and covariance matrices \eqn{(1,0;0,1)}, \eqn{(}\code{sigma1}^2\eqn{,0;0,1)} respectively, and \eqn{G_{2}}{G2} is an equally-weighted mixture of two Gaussians with mean \eqn{(0,0)} and covariance matrices \eqn{(}\code{sigma2}^2,\code{rho};\code{rho},\code{tau}^2 \eqn{)} and \eqn{(}\code{sigma2}^2,-\code{rho};-\code{rho},\code{tau}^2 \eqn{)}.

The model is thus characterised by the vector \code{\link{pars}}=(\code{pi0},\code{pi1},\code{tau},\code{sigma1},\code{sigma2},\code{rho}). Under the null hypothesis that SNPs which differentiate subtypes are not in general associated with the phenotype, we have \code{sigma2}=1, \code{rho}=0.

In estimating the null distribution of the test statistic, frequently the only available null test cases have \code{\link{tau}=1}. This can cause false-positives if \code{Z_{a}} is better-fit by a three gaussian distribution than two.

To overcome this, we maximise the likelihood conditioning on the observed values of \code{Z_{a}}

This function finds the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators for the paramaters of these three Gaussians, and the mixing parameters representing the proportion of SNPs in each category.
